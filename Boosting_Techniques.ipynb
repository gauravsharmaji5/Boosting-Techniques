        "\n",
        "Boosting is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners (models that perform slightly better than random guessing) to create a strong learner with high predictive accuracy.\n",

        "\n",
        "In traditional ML models (like XGBoost or LightGBM), categorical features usually need to be converted to numeric values using one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding.\n",

        "Blow up dataset size (many columns if categories are high-cardinality).\n",

        "Example: Replace a category with the mean target value for that category.\n",

        "It uses a permutation of the dataset and calculates statistics in an online fashion (only from previous rows, not future ones).\n",
